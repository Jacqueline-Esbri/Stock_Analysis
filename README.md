# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

Performing different analysis through the use of Excel's VBA Developer tool. We were also able to determine if refacturing of the code made the code better, or run faster.

### Purpose

An Excel workbook was presented to us by an individual named Steve. The workbook contained stock data for green energy stocks in years 2017 and 2018. Steve wanted to help his parents diversify their portfolio, which was only invested in DAQO green energy stock, but was concerned about going through the process. As a result, he reached out for our help. Our job was to help analyze the stock data in this workbook.

The purpose of this analysis was to efficiently analyze Steve's stock data provided to us in green_stocks_xls workbook. By using the powerful tool of Excel's VBA, we were able to analyze the data automatically versus perfoming the analysis manually. The analysis was accomplished by using a series of programming readable codes. In doing so, we decreased the chance of making erros as well as saved time.

By the end of the analysis, we provided him with important information extracted by VBA such as, total volume, yearly return values, formatting the the worksheets for easier visualization, and providing tools of access within the sheet.

### Summary

Reafactoring code, according to our module, is essentially editing the existing code to determine if it will run faster than the one that was initially provided to us. In order for it to properly work, it needs to be done in small steps. The steps are completed without major changes to existing code (e.g., external behavior, functionality).

Refacturing codes, however, can have its advantages as well as disadvantages. The following are the advantages and disadvantages that caught my attention:

###### Disadvantages

- Some parts of the code may be repeated in several parts of the code
- It may inadvertently introduced unwanted bugs
- The process may affect the testing outcomes

###### Advantages

- Errors appear with ease
- It is mostly safe since one may not refactor without testing
- Since run times may be shorter, it can boost the system's performance
- It is possible to make it easier to read than original version

Refacturing code appeared to be effective and eeficient. It cleaned up the existing code and made it easier to read by others. Additionally, it is easy to maintain, edit, and comprehend.

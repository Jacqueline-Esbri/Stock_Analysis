# Stock Analysis 









## Overview of Analysis

Performing different analysis through the use of Excel's VBA Developer tool.






### Purpose

An Excel workbook was presented to us by an individual named Steve. The workbook contained stock data for green energy stocks in years 2017 and 2018. Steve wanted to help his parents diversify their portfolio, which was only invested in DAQO green energy stock, but was concerned about going through the process. As a result, he reached out for our help. Our job was to help analyze the stock data in this workbook.

The purpose of this analysis was to efficiently analyze Steve's stock data provided to us in gree_stocks_xls workbook. By using the powerful tool of Excel's VBA, we were able to analyze the data automatically versus perfoming the analysis manually. The analysis was accomplished by using a series of programming readable codes. In doing so, we decreased the chance of making erros as well as saved time. 

By the end of the analysis, we provided him with important information extracted by VBA such as, total volume, yearly return values, formatting the the worksheets for easier visualization, and providing tools of access within the sheet.

### Summary
